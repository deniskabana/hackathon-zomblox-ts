## Zomblocks Hackathon

A simple top-down shooter game made from ground-up by me as a hackathon and a challenge project. Drawing heavily from my Unity experience, implementing everything in OOP TS.

The aim for MVP after 24hrs of work:

1. My own UI, Draw and Level managers
2. Single-player, 3 weapons, day-night cycle, shop
3. Zombies spawning during the night, flow field path finding, large amounts
4. Endless survival and menu with proper credits
